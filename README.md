Hi Guys!!

So I created this game of tic tac toe just to get a better understanding of Python.
If you find any bugs will be happy to be notified about them or even better if someone debugs and sends a PR :)
To execute the program head to the directory where tictactoe.py is placed and execute is using the command:

python3 tictactoe.py
